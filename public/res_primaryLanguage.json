What I lack in direct software development experience I make up for in about every other aspect. I have lots of experience working with and leading small teams, I am very mission focused, and very good at simply getting the job done. All of this I learned from my time as an Infantryman. I now go to Code Fellows to work towards becoming a full-stack software developer! ",
